# Multiple Linear Regression Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates the application of Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) to predict outcomes based on multiple input features. MLR is a statistical technique that models the relationship between two or more features and a response variable by fitting a linear equation to observed data.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- plotly

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn plotly
```

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Load the dataset and perform any necessary data cleaning and preprocessing, such as handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
2. **Feature Selection**: Select the relevant features for training the model.
3. **Model Training**: Fit the Multiple Linear Regression model using the training dataset.
4. **Predictions**: Use the trained model to make predictions on the test dataset.
5. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like R² score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Residual Sum of Squares (RSS).

Example of training a model:

```python
from sklearn import linear_model
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, r2_score
import pandas as pd

# Load dataset
data = pd.read_csv('path_to_your_dataset.csv')

# Prepare features and target variable
X = data[['feature1', 'feature2', 'feature3']]
y = data['target']

# Split the dataset
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train the model
model = linear_model.LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
print("Mean Absolute Error:", mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred))
print("R² Score:", r2_score(y_test, y_pred))
```

## Dataset

Include a brief description of the dataset used in this project. Provide information about the features, target variable, and any preprocessing steps that were applied.

Example:
- **Dataset Name**: CO2 Emissions Dataset
- **Features**:
  - `ENGINESIZE`: Size of the engine in liters
  - `CYLINDERS`: Number of cylinders in the engine
  - `FUELCONSUMPTION_HWY`: Fuel consumption on the highway (L/100km)
- **Target Variable**: `CO2 Emissions`: CO2 emissions (g/km)

## Evaluation Metrics

The following metrics are used to evaluate the model's performance:

- **Residual Sum of Squares (RSS)**: Measures the total deviation of the predicted values from the actual values.
- **R² Score**: Represents the proportion of variance explained by the model, with a value closer to 1 indicating a better fit.
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Represents the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values.
