# Simple Linear Regression

## Introduction
Simple Linear Regression is a fundamental statistical technique used to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. It helps in understanding how the dependent variable changes with the independent variable, enabling predictions and insights.

## Objectives
- To understand the concept of linear regression.
- To learn how to implement simple linear regression using Python.
- To explore the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the regression model.

## Dataset
This project uses a dataset that includes features such as engine size and CO2 emissions. The goal is to predict CO2 emissions based on engine size.

## Key Steps
1. **Data Loading**: Importing the necessary libraries and loading the dataset.
2. **Data Exploration**: Using methods like `head()`, `info()`, and visualizations to understand the data.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
4. **Model Training**: Using the training set to fit a linear regression model.
5. **Prediction**: Making predictions on the test set and comparing them with actual values.
6. **Evaluation**: Calculating metrics such as Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, and RÂ² score to evaluate the model's performance.

## Visualization
Visualizations are included to illustrate the relationship between the variables and the fit of the regression model, helping to understand the data better.
